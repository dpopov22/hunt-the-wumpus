# hunt-the-wumpus
The purpose of the Hunt The Wumpus project is to create a game through the implementation of a graph data structure. 
The graph data structure uses vertices and edges to create a connected grid of "rooms, "
which in this case, allows for the Hunter to travel from room to room in search of the Wumpus. This graph is undirected, 
which allowed for the Hunter to move back to a room he had already been in. In addition to the graph data structure, 
this project uses a BST Map,Hashmap, Arrays, Array lists, Heaps, and a Linked List to create the game successfully. 
It also utilizes inheritance, since the Hunter and Wumpus classes have to inherit methods from the Agent class. 
After completing the project, I had a playable Hunt the Wumpus game in which the Hunter could kill the rumpus by shooting, 
or die by stumbling upon the wumpus/missing his shot.
